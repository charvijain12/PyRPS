# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors game in Python

This code is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that runs in an infinite loop until the user chooses to exit by entering 'E' or 'e'. The user can choose their weapon by entering 'R', 'P' or 'S'. If the user input is invalid, the code will ask for a valid input. The computer's weapon is selected randomly from the choices 'R', 'P', and 'S'. The code then checks who wins the game based on the standard Rock, Paper, Scissors rules. If both the user and the computer choose the same weapon, it's a tie. If the computer wins, it will print "I win!" and if the user wins, it will print "You win!".
