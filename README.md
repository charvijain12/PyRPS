# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a Python implementation of the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game is played between two players, where each player chooses one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner of the game is determined by the following rules:

1. Rock beats scissors
2. 
3. Scissors beats paper
4. 
5. Paper beats rock

The game can be played against the computer or against another player. The player makes their choice by entering a corresponding number, and the computer's choice is randomly generated. The game then determines the winner based on the rules above and displays the result.

The program is implemented using basic programming constructs such as conditional statements, loops, and functions. The user interface is simple and easy to use, with clear prompts and instructions.

## Usage
To run the program, simply execute the `rps.py` file in a Python environment. The program will prompt the user to choose between playing against the computer or against another player. The user will then be prompted to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors). The program will then generate the computer's choice (if playing against the computer) and determine the winner.
